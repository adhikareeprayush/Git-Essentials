### Why Use Git?

**Version Control**
One of the main reason of using git is for version control. A version control system can be used to track the changes in the code.
Let's take a senario where we have multiple versions of our project in our local storage.

In above example, I have seperate folders of all the changed codes as versions of my project. It is very hard to maintain and stresses me outðŸ˜–.

Using git just simplifies the process. We can change the code and create separate versions of our code/project as commit which is stored in the git locally or remotely. Then we can access the dififerent versions of our project. lets take a visual representation of what I have just saidðŸ¤¯.

Can git be used only locally? What will happen if my hard disk is damaged? What if I lost my computer?

For these types of situations we can use **Git Provider .** By using git provider we can store the projects both locally and on the cloud too.
